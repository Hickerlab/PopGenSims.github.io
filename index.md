# Welcome to CompPhylo - Model-based inference in Phylogeography from single species to communities

more boilerplate phylogeography stuff here

CompPhylo workshops are designed to introduce a myriad of tools for making statistical
inference about historical processes using genetic/genomic data.

# What is phylogeography/comparative phylogeography?

# Who should attend?
CompPhylo workshops are geared toward practicing field biologists with little or no computational experience.

Workshop attendees will need to bring a laptop computer.
