# Model-based inference in Phylogeography from single species to communities

CompPhylo workshops are designed to introduce a myriad of tools for making 
statistical inference about historical processes using genetic/genomic data. 
After introducing statistical approaches in model-based inferences, participants
will be introduced to inference frameworks that span taxonomic scales from 
single-species demographic inference, to multi-species comparative analysis, to
inference at the scale of the whole community. Participants will also get hands
on experience using approximate Bayesian computation, supervised machine 
learning and composite likelihood methods for model comparison.

Participants will work on sample datasets but are also encouraged to bring their 
own data. Advantages and limitations of each method and the fit to participant's 
datasets, field sampling design as well as the selection and use of genetic 
markers will be actively discussed. In addition, to strengthen connections and 
exchanges between researchers, participants will have the opportunity to present 
their own work in the evenings.

### MESS
MESS is a novel comparative phylogeographic model grounded in community 
ecological theory will be introduced. This integrative approach makes use of 
four data axes (distributions of traits, abundances, genetic diversities/
divergences, and phylogenetic patterns) to enable testing alternative community 
assembly models (neutral vs non-neutral) and estimating parameters underlying 
different assembly processes (e.g. dispersal vs in situ speciation). These 
methods which capitalize on the widespread use of DNA barcoding and 
meta-barcoding approaches will be implemented in the software package MESS 
designed by I. Overcast.

* What kind of genetic data it uses: MESS requires population-level sampling (5-10
individuals per species) from a local community or multiple local communities.
This can be at a variety of scales ranging from a microbial community within a host 
individual, a locally sampled plot targeting everything from a taxonomic group, to a 
regional assemblage that emerged via disersal and/or local speciation. Currently only 
single locus data is supported, so community metabarcoding projects would be quite 
appropriate. Other data types can be included but are not required (abundances, per taxon 
trait metrics, and phylogenetic information).

### Multi-DICE
multi-taxa demographic inferences using hierarchical models in the R packages 
multi-DICE and PipeMaster authored by A. Xue and M. Gehara respectively. Finally,

### PipeMaster
PipeMaster is an R-package to build demographic models and simulate data under the coalescent model. Current implementation can simulate sanger-type and nexgen data for single species or complex of species. It is also possible to simulate single-locus data for hierarchical demographic models of comparative phylogeography and species trees with one horizontal connection (Phylogenetic Networks).
PipeMaster simulates summary statistics and coalescent trees. It calculates the same summary statistics on an empirical data. The user can use these sumary statistics to perform aproximate Bayesian computation (ABC) or supervized machine learning (SML) for model and parameter inference.

* What kind of data it uses: Sanger, UCE, Radseq, ddRad, Anchored loci for non-hierarchical models. PipeMaster does not use the SFS, but fasta alignments of the entire loci with monomorphic sites. Alignments of invariable loci should also be included in the input. Single-locus data for comparative demography.

## Who should attend?
CompPhylo workshops are geared toward practicing field biologists with little
or no computational experience. General knowledge in evolutionary biology, 
population genetic and phylogenetic analyses. Basic knowledge in R. bash/Linux 
and python scripting/commands scripting is useful.

Workshop attendees will need to bring a laptop computer.
