# Welcome to CompPhylo 2019 - Oslo Edition

Sponsored by [Forskerskole i biosystematikk (ForBio)](https://www.forbio.uio.no/) & [UiO:Life Science](https://www.uio.no/english/research/strategic-research-areas/life-science/)  

ForBio and UiO:Life Science jointly offer a generator workshop on model-based demographic inferences of both single species and communities. The workshop aims to learn and apply new tools to elucidate phylogeographic patterns, biogeographic shifts and demographic responses of single- and multi-taxa as well as to contribute to knowledge exchange on methodological challenges and diverse biological systems for this cutting-edge field of research.

August 26-30, 2019
